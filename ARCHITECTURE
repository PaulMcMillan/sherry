Sherry runs a built-in flask webserver on port 24601 and provides the
following endpoints:

 - pxe/chain.pxe

	iPXE chainload.  Will load a new iPXE script for the specific
	mac address

 - pxe/{mac-addr}

	iPXE script to boot a specific system.  This will either return
	instructions to stream the installation initramfs from the labvm,
	or instruct the booting system to chain to the bootload on disk.
